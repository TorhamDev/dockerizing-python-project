1. Create a Dockerfile with the following content:
```dockerfile

   # Set base image
   FROM python:3.9

   # Set working directory in container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy project files to container
   COPY . /app

   # Install required packages
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Expose required ports
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Set default command to run the app
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   
```
2. In your project directory, create a new file called requirements.txt listing all the Python packages that your project depends on.

3. Run the following command in your project directory to build the Docker image: 

      `docker build -t myproject .`
   

   This command tells Docker to build the image, tag it with the name myproject, and use the current directory (.) as the build context.

4. After building the image, you can start a container by running the following command:

      `docker run -p 8000:8000 myproject`
   

   This command tells Docker to start a container based on the myproject image, map port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container, and run the default command specified in the Dockerfile.

5. Now you should be able to access your Python application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

That's it! Dockerizing a Python project can be a straightforward process with just a few steps. Of course, depending on your specific project requirements, you may need to modify the Dockerfile or docker run command to suit your needs.

# Step-By-Step [detailed]

### Create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Set base image
FROM python:3.9
```

This line tells Docker to use the official Python 3.9 base image as a starting point for our container. We can use any other valid base image if our project requires a different runtime environment.

```dockerfile
# Set working directory in container
WORKDIR /app
``` 

This line sets the working directory inside the container to /app. We'll use this directory to copy our project files and run the application.

```dockerfile
# Copy project files to container
COPY . /app
```  

This line tells Docker to copy all of the files in our local directory to the /app directory in the container.

```dockerfile
# Install required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

This line installs the required packages defined in our requirements.txt file inside the container. pip is the Python package manager, and the `--no-cache-dir` flag tells it not to use any cache files since we're building a new image.

```dockerfile
# Expose required ports
EXPOSE 8000
```

This line tells Docker to expose port 8000 in our container. We'll use this port to access our Python application.

```dockerfile
# Set default command to run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
``` 

This line sets the default command to run when the container starts. In this case, it's running python app.py. You can replace app.py with the name of your main Python file.


### Run the following command in your project directory to build the Docker image:


`docker build -t myproject .`


This line tells Docker to build an image with the tag myproject based on the Dockerfile in the current directory (.). Docker will process every line of the Dockerfile to build a new image with our project and all its dependencies installed.

### After building the image, you can start a container by running the following command:

`docker run -p 8000:8000 myproject`


This line tells Docker to start a new container based on the myproject image we just built and map port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host. We can then access our Python application on http://localhost:8000.

Optionally, you can add the -d flag at the end of this command to run the container in detached mode.

### Finally, you can stop the running container using the following command:

`docker stop <container-id>`
   

*You can get the container ID by running the `docker ps` command.*

That's the basic process for dockerizing a Python project! Remember, some Python projects may require more complex setup, so you may need to modify the Dockerfile or the docker run command according to your specific needs.
